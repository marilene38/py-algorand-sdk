## Problem

<!-- Describe the problem or limitation you're facing. For example:
- Are there missing features in the SDK?
- Are you unable to connect wallets (e.g., Pera, Defly)?
- Is ASA creation, querying, or management difficult?
- Are payment requests, withdrawal clawbacks, or fee calculations unsupported?
- Are there challenges with smart contracts, NFTs, or DApps? -->

<details>
  <summary>Examples of Problems:</summary>
  - The SDK lacks tools to connect wallets like Pera or Defly.
  - No utilities for programmatically managing ASAs or NFTs.
  - Payment requests or clawbacks are hard to implement via the SDK.
  - Missing functionality for supporting DApps or smart contract interactions.
  - Consensus mechanisms are not represented in SDK tools.
